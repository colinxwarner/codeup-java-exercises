/*
Create two classes in a package called "prep":
Arthimetic.java - all static methods inside
square - takes in an int argument, returns the square of that number as an int
sum - takes in two numeric (your choice of type) arguments, returns the sum of both
difference - takes in two numeric (your choice of type) arguments, returns the difference between the two
product - takes in two numeric (your choice of type) arguments, returns the product (multiply)
average - takes in a numeric array as an argument, returns the average of that array
App.java
has a main() method which is where you will test all of the methods of Arithmetic
