//# Intro to Java
//
//        ## Java Highlights
//
//        - one of the most widely used programming languages in history
//        - strong continuing demand for Java developers
//        - often used in Computer Science programs as an introduction to programming
//        - predominantly used in enterprise web app development and Android mobile development
//        - developed at Sun Microsystems in the early nineties (primary designer, James Gosling)
//        - Java was made to be fast, secure, and flexible enough to run on any hardware and OS
//
//        ## JavaScript vs. Java
//
//        - Hamburger vs. Ham (languages are not directly related)
//        - JavaScript primarily runs on a browser engine... Java on any JVM on any machine
//        - JavaScript is dynamically types (variables may be reassigned a different data type)... Java variables must be of a declared types and cannot be changed to a different type
//        - Objects in JavaScript were mostly equivalent to a named index array... Java objects are entirely different
//        - JavaScript statements may be inside or outside functions, arrays, objects, etc.... Java statements must be written inside methods inside a class
//        - We will use JavaScript during this program for client-side (browser or front-end) scripting... we will use Java for server-side (back end) scripting
//        - JavaScript is single-threaded... Java is multi-threaded
//        - JavaScript is a relatively high-level language (lower performance, simpler syntax)... Java is more a mid-level language (higher performance, more explicit syntax)
//
//
//
//        ## How Java Runs
//
//        1. Programmer writes source code in a .java file (the following additional steps may be done automatically by an IDE or manually)
//        1. .java file is compiled by the Java Compiler into a .class file that contains Java bytecode instructions (normally hexadecimal/binary code that map to Java opcodes)
//        1. .class file may then be run on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
//        1. the JVM implements the bytecode instructions in a specific operating system way, depending on which JVM version the code is running on
//

//        ================================= JAVA INTRO READING QUESTIONS
//        What is the difference between a .java and .class file?
//        Why are we using an IDE (IntelliJ) instead of a simple text editor for writing Java code?
//        What is the difference between a JRE and a JDK?
//        Are we currently learning about JavaSE, JavaEE, JavaME, or JavaFX?
//        What are some key differences between JavaScript and Java?
//        Describe in some detail the process by which a Java program is able to run on an operating system.
//        Why is Java touted as a “write once, run anywhere” language?
//
//
//        Please take some time with your breakout room to review the following questions together (you will need to look to the Syntax lesson to answer some of the questions)…
//        What is the difference between compiled and interpreted languages? Static and dynamic? Which is Java, which is JavaScript?
//        What does a compiler do?
//        What is a virtual machine?
//        What is the difference between bytecode and source code files?
//        Do you need the JDK or the JRE to play Minecraft?
//        Why would you use an IDE?
//        What is the purpose of the out directory?
//        Why does Java have multiple number data types? Why use one over the other?
//        Is a string a primitive type in Java?
//        What is the difference between explicit and implicit casting? What are specific examples?
//        What are some differences between char and String types?
//        What happens if you store a number in a variable greater than the data type’s constraints?
