//        Exercises
//        For all of the following exercises, create a new class named ControlFlowExercises with a main method.
//        After each exercise, commit your changes, then replace your code in the main method with the next exercise.
//
//        Loop Basics
//
//        While
//
//        Create an integer variable i with a value of 5.
//        int i = 5;
//        Create a while loop that runs so long as i is less than or equal to 15
//
//        Each loop iteration, output the current value of i, then increment i by one.
//        Your output should look like this:
//         5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15

//        Do While
//
//        Create a do-while loop that will count by 2's starting with 0 and ending at 100. Follow each number with a new line.


//        Alter your loop to count backwards by 5's from 100 to -10.


//        Create a do-while loop that starts at 2, and displays the number squared on each line while the number is less than 1,000,000.
//        Output should equal:
//         2
//         4
//         16
//         256
//         65536


//        For
//
//        Refactor the previous two exercises to use a for loop instead.

//        Fizzbuzz
//
//        One of the most common interview questions for entry-level programmers is the FizzBuzz test. Developed by Imran Ghory, the test is designed to assess basic looping and conditional logic skills.
//
//        Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
//        For multiples of three: print “Fizz” instead of the number.
//        For the multiples of five: print “Buzz”.
//        For numbers which are multiples of both three and five: print “FizzBuzz”.

//        Display a table of powers.
//
//        Prompt the user to enter an integer.

//        Display a table of squares and cubes from 1 to the value entered.
//        Ask if the user wants to continue.

//        Assume that the user will enter valid data.

//        Only continue if the user agrees to.

//        Example Output
//          What number would you like to go up to? 5
//
//          Here is your table!
//
//          number | squared | cubed
//          ------ | ------- | -----
//          1      | 1       | 1
//          2      | 4       | 8
//          3      | 9       | 27
//          4      | 16      | 64
//          5      | 25      | 125
